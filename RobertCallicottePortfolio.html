               <div class="main-content"> Welcome! I'm Robert Callicotte, and I'm thrilled to introduce you to my Personal Portfolio.</div>
      <div class="main-content"> Here, you'll discover a vibrant collection of projects that showcase my professional skills and dedication.</div>
      <div class="main-content"> This website, which I handcrafted, serves as a 'home page' and a key part of my portfolio. It's a window into my world, featuring several of my projects.</div>
      <div class="main-content"> The highlight among them is Battle-Honor, my latest and greatest creation. You'll find more details about it in the link above!</div>
      <div class="main-content"> But let's shift gears a bit! I'd love to share a bit about myself.</div>
      <article class="main-content"> 
    <p class="main-content"> I graduated from the University of Georgia with a psychology degree in spring 2017, which led me to an exciting career as a Developmental Disabilities Professional (DDP).</p>
    <p class="main-content"> In this role, I honed my skills in managing operations for Adult day programs. My journey didn't stop there; inspired by my success, I pursued a master's degree in Psychology.</p>
    <p class="main-content"> The master's program was a game-changer for me. It was my first deep dive into managing and analyzing data, where I discovered my innate love for complex algorithms. This passion kickstarted my journey into data analytics, leading me to earn several certifications in the field.</p>

               <h2>Welcome to Battle-Honor!</h2>

    <div class="project-description">
        <p>Embark on an adrenaline-fueled journey with <em>Battle-Honor</em>, a fast-paced fighting game in development for the past 3 months. Designed to connect players globally, it promises real-time, thrilling combat experiences. While the game isn't yet available for download, you can dive into its inner workings through the full source code on my GitHub page, accessible at the top of this site.</p>
        <p>This ambitious project springs to life with the help of <em>Unity</em>, a powerful game development platform known for its versatility and user-friendly interface. Unity enables developers to create immersive 2D and 3D experiences, making it an ideal choice for bringing <em>Battle-Honor</em> to life.</p>
        <p>The game's backbone is scripted in C#, a language I've recently added to my toolkit. It's not just about the code, though. A significant part of the magic happens through <em>Photon Fusion</em>, a robust netcode framework. Photon Fusion simplifies backend development, letting me concentrate on game creation. However, it's not all smooth sailing; I've dedicated around 85% of my development time to mastering Fusion's API documentation, enhancing my understanding of servers, hosts, clients, and packet management.</p>
        <p>This journey has been intense and enlightening, pushing the boundaries of my skills and patience. With continued dedication, I aim to have <em>Battle-Honor</em> ready for playtesting by February 2024. Stay tuned for more updates on this exciting venture!</p>

         <button onclick="toggleDropdown('Stock Tracker')">Stock Tracker</button>   
         <div id = "Stock Tracker" class = "dropdown-content">
            <div>
               <h2>Lets review some stocks!</h2>
               <div class="Stock-pic"></div>
    <div class="project-description">
      <p>Ever been curious about which stock to purchase, but never knew about historical trends? This is the basic premise of my "Stock Tracker". Just type in any ticker you want with the appropriate time frame you're looking for and boom! Instant access to historical trends. All the code for this project can be found on my GitHub link at the top of this webpage.</p>
      <p>Well, how does this work, you might ask? This app calls the Yahoo Finance API to retrieve information about the requested ticker a user inputs and then returns back to the view two graphs. One graph displays opening prices, and another shows closing prices within a specified time frame.</p>
      <p>The graphs in particular are based on Plotly, which, in my personal opinion, I find more effective than Matplotlib. The combination of Plotly's advanced features and the reliable data from Yahoo Finance API ensures that the information provided is both accurate and visually appealing.</p>
      <p>Please feel free to download the project and play around with it yourself! The "Stock Tracker" not only provides valuable insights into stock market trends but also showcases my skills in integrating APIs and data visualization tools effectively.</p>
